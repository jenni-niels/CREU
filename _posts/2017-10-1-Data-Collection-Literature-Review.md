## Week Ending 1 October

This past week I've helped to schedule volunteers to participate in the study as well as worked with the team to help advertise the study.  We hope to find another 20 participants this month.

We also discussed next steps for the audio analysis which I will use to guide my literature review next week.

I've also continue my literature and application review, and have found the following tools:

* [Voice Base](http://voicebase.readthedocs.io/en/v2-beta/index.html): for transcripts and keyword detection
* [Prosodylab-Aligner](https://github.com/prosodylab/Prosodylab-Aligner): for transcript alignment and keyword location
