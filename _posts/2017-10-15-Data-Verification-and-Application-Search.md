## Week Ending 15 October

I've contitiuded to help facilitate schedualing volenteers.  In addition as a team we have begun to go through the data we have collected and manually verifiy that it is sound before using it as training data.

I'm still looking for more applications, although I have also downloaded the tools found last time to start getting a feel for what their capapilities are.  They have proven tricky to install, so hopefully I will have more information about that in the next couple days.

Note: My computer crashed for a few days last week.  It has now been restored and is up and running again.  And I hope to make up for that lost time this week.
