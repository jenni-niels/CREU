Over the past week I worked with volunteers to guide them through their
participation in the study, as well working with the team to continue to
facilitate the study.

We also now have transcripts from one a previously preformed study.  I have
been working on developing python code to analysis them, so that we can decide
what type of content to look at in this and future studies.  In the next week
I plan to improve my code a bit and use it to collect data from all of the
transcripts.
