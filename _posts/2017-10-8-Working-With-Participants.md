## Week Ending 8 October

I've continued to help schedule volunteers, as well has to guide them through
their participation in the study.  We introduce them to basic premise of the study
and make sure remind them of their right to remove consent if they wish.  Participants
are then shown the FACES software.  I show them how the different feature work,
and how to use the various selection menus, and then observe their sketch as the
create it so that I can offer suggestions for how to make it more accurate.
