I've been continuing to add noun recognition / filtering to my transcript
analysis code.  I've been reading through 
[Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book_1ed/) to
familiarize myself with the tool kit and as reference.

In addition I meet with the team briefly to discuss our plans for next
semester.  It seems like my next project will be to implement a GUI to
facilitate use of the existing code.  I intend to start researching libraries
to build such a thing, specially in python as there are plans to port much of
the current research into python.  I will also continue to see if there's a way
to port the existing Matlab code, although my initial research and attempts
have not been fruitful.
