## Week Ending 24 September

This week I was introduced to the FACES sketch software.  It is software that
allows the user to build forensics sketches by selecting different facial components.
There are about 20 types of facial components, from hair, to nose shape, and wrinkles,
and for each component their are hundreds of options to choose from.

I started by building my own sketch.  It's something I found quite difficult
and time consuming, both given the shear number of options, but also as I
tended to get stuck trying to choose the best choice for a feature between similar
options, were all the choices were slightly of from reality.  I found that my
brain would become desensitized to the differences and I would have to move on to
a different feature and finish the more subtle choices later.

In general I found that the best way to create a sketch was to go feature by 
feature and get each one recognizably accurate before moving on the next, and
then going back to the end to make final adjustments.
