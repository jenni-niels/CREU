Before break we discussed building a GUI for the existing applications that
the team has, to make it easier for other people without as much technical
knowledge to use as well as allow people to run the code without needing access
to the MatLab backend.

To the first end I've been researching GUI modules for python.  The built in
Tkinter module looked like it might useful and I spend much of the week
learning how about the objects it has and how to nest them properly such that
what appears on the window is usable.  I found the this [tutorial](https://www.python-course.eu/python_tkinter.php) particularly helpful. I have had some prior experience with
event based programing, but not with the style of graphical monitors that
Tkinter uses.  One of the first steps I've taken there is to figure out how to
embed a file selection dialog, and retrieve the data from the various widgets.

In addition, I've started to look into how to port Matlab code, which is much
of our backend, into python.  So far I have not had much success with that, so
hopefully I will understand that better next week.
