I still haven’t had much success exporting MATLAB code to python yet.
Despite my research I continue to run into compilation and linker errors, and
am still not sure what the all of the dependencies required are.

In addition I’ve continued work on the GUI.  I’ve been learning about Tkinter
frames so that I can call mine and the lab’s previous work from it and plot the
results.  I’ve started by taking the Matplotlib results generated from the
functionality and working to embed those plots in Tkinter frames.
