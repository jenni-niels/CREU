This week I continued to work on the exporting Matlab into callable executable
problem.  It has taken many iterations of failure and crashing Matlab runtime
environments, but so far I have managed to update my version of Matlab to the
most recent one and then determine which add-on applications were needed to
install (libraryCompilation, etc.)  Currently I have *theoretically* exported
a function into a python module, however when I try to install those binaries
I run into linker errors, and I'm still working to figure what is not working
in that step.

In addition through discussing with the team to pin down more specific goals, 
I've been able to refine my literature review as well as Speech API search.
